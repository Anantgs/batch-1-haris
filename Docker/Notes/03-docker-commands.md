### Commands and arguments

```
- You can use the [COMMAND] and [ARG...] positional arguments to specify commands and 
arguments for the container to run when it starts up. 

- For example, you can specify sh as the [COMMAND], combined with the -i and -t flags, 
to start an interactive shell in the container (if the image you select has an sh executable on PATH).
```

```
docker run -it IMAGE sh
```
